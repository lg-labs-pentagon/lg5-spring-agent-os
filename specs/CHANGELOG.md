# Changelog — lg5-spring-agent-os specs bundle

All notable changes to the **specs** artifact set are documented here.
Uses [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.1] — 2026-05-13
### Changed (PATCH — bundle 4.1.1)
- `manifest.yaml` `bundle.version` bumped to `4.1.1` per the cross-bundle
  invariant. No spec template changed; the 4.1.1 release ships a fix to
  `scripts/install.sh` (housekeeping-files-leak — issue #15) reflected in
  full in `skills/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-13
### Added (MINOR — bundle 4.1.0)
- **`quick-spec-template`** (v0.1.0) — compressed single-page spec for
  the SDD Quick-path. Hard cap: **40 content lines**. Sections: Change
  (one sentence), Rationale (one sentence + observable outcome), Scope
  (type/modules/file counts/RULE-NNNs), Acceptance criteria (1-3 ACs
  in Given/When/Then), Non-goals (≥1), Open questions (ideally empty).
  Used by `/sdd-quick` and the `sdd-quicker` subagent. Replaces
  Specify+Plan+Design+Tasks for trivial changes. `/sdd-verify` remains
  mandatory.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-10
### Added (MAJOR — bundle 3.0.0)
- **3 new templates** covering the extended SDD workflow:
  - **`intent-template`** (v0.1.0) — one-page intent for `/sdd-intent`.
    Captures problem statement, who feels it, why now, desired outcome
    (observable terms only — no solution words), success metrics
    (≥1 measurable baseline + target), non-goals, constraints, and
    open questions. Hard cap ~120 lines.
  - **`design-template`** (v0.1.0) — detailed technical design for
    `/sdd-design`. Covers scope, domain model index, REST contracts
    (RULE-006), Kafka contracts + Avro schemas (RULE-007, RULE-010),
    persistence + outbox (RULE-008), saga design (RULE-009), config
    (RULE-014), module dep graph (RULE-004, acyclic), test design
    (input to `/sdd-tasks` and `/sdd-verify`), skipped sections with
    justification, and open questions. Pairs with `data-model-template`.
  - **`verify-report-template`** (v0.1.0) — closing-gate report for
    `/sdd-verify`. AC↔evidence matrix with 5 status values
    (✅ pass / ⚠ flaky / ❌ fail / ⚪ uncovered / 🟡 manual), coverage
    summary, TASK↔REQ traceability, manual verifications, constitutional
    check per RULE-NNN, gaps + overrides table, gate decision
    (VERIFIED / VERIFIED WITH OVERRIDE / NOT VERIFIED).
### Changed (BREAKING)
- **`data-model-template`** ownership reassigned from `/sdd-plan` to
  `/sdd-design`. The template file is unchanged, but its consumer
  moves one phase later in the workflow. Existing examples that
  produced `data-model.md` from the Plan phase remain valid as
  historical artifacts.
### Notes
- Bundle bumped to `3.0.0` (MAJOR) via the cross-bundle invariant —
  `bundle.version` must match across all manifest.yaml files even when
  the per-template versions only changed minor/patch.
- Example `loyalty-ledger` will be retrofitted with `intent.md`,
  `design.md`, and `verify-report.md` in a follow-up PR (3.0.1).

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-10
### Changed
- Framework SHA pin bumped from `af81c7c` to `d0d754a` (PATCH).
- Includes [`fix(testcontainers)`: in-network Kafka listener](https://github.com/lg-labs-pentagon/lg5-spring/pull/1)
  — surfaced while wiring the first downstream Kafka listener IT in
  `lg5-loyalty-ledger` TASK-009.
- Also pulls in [LG-83] Jib Maven plugin upgrade to 3.5.1 (transitive on
  the framework parent pom).
### Notes
- **No spec template or example content changed** in this release.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-10
### Changed
- Framework SHA pin bumped from `cbb6783` to `af81c7c` to honor RULE-001's
  Spring Boot 3.4.2 requirement (`cbb6783` actually shipped 3.3.5,
  discovered during consumer-service TASK-002 of `lg5-loyalty-ledger`).
- `bundle.version` in `manifest.yaml` bumped to `0.3.1` (PATCH; cross-bundle
  invariant requires every per-type manifest to agree).
### Notes
- **No spec template or example content changed** in this release.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-09
### Added
- **Spec-Driven Development workflow** formalized following Fowler/spec-kit:
  Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement, each phase consuming a template
  and producing a per-feature markdown under `docs/specs/<NNN-slug>/`.
- New templates under `templates/`:
  - `plan-template.md` — technical plan (module map, ADR index,
    dependency graph, risks, DoD checklist).
  - `tasks-template.md` — atomic TASK-NNN with Given/When/Then AC and
    Definition of Done checklist.
  - `data-model-template.md` — concrete shapes (aggregates, events,
    outbox payloads, REST DTOs, Avro schemas, JPA tables).
  - `research-template.md` — optional time-boxed spike doc.
- `specs/README.md` documenting the SDD workflow and per-feature folder
  layout for consumer services.
- The illustrative `loyalty-ledger` example was **split** into a
  per-feature folder under `examples/loyalty-ledger/`:
  `prd.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `data-model.md`, `README.md`,
  `adr/ADR-001-outbox-only-no-saga.md`,
  `adr/ADR-002-reuse-order-message-model.md`. This shape is what
  consumer services replicate under `docs/specs/<NNN-slug>/`.
### Changed
- `prd-template.md` rewritten: requirements now use stable `REQ-NNN` IDs;
  Definition of Done checklist embedded; the template explicitly forbids
  technology mentions to keep PRDs purely functional.
- `adr-template.md`: the "lg5 rule cross-references" section is renamed
  to **"Constitutional impact"** to align with the new constitution
  vocabulary (see `rules/CONSTITUTION.md`); DoD checklist embedded.
- `manifest.yaml` reorganized: explicit `templates/` and `examples/`
  groupings; example entry now points to a folder.
- `validate.sh` updated to walk `templates/` + recurse into
  `examples/<feature>/` and to accept the new `example-*` `kind` values.
### Removed
- Old monolithic `examples/microservice-spec-example.md` (split into the
  per-feature folder above; nothing lost in content).
### Notes
- Validated against `lg5-spring` SHA `cbb6783`.
- Inspired by the spec-kit per-feature folder shape and DoD checklists.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-09
### Added
- `prd-template.md` — Product Requirements Document template with sections
  for problem, users, success metrics, scope, out-of-scope, dependencies,
  and acceptance criteria.
- `adr-template.md` — Lightweight ADR template (context, decision,
  alternatives, consequences) with a "lg5 rule cross-references" section.
- `examples/microservice-spec-example.md` — End-to-end spec example for a
  hypothetical `loyalty-ledger` service combining the PRD + ADRs + module
  breakdown.
### Notes
- Validated against `lg5-spring` SHA `cbb6783`.
- Spec format is plain markdown with YAML frontmatter (`kind`, `version`,
  `description`); designed to be filled in by humans or by the
  `lg5-planner` subagent.
